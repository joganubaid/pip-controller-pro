## Build Options

```powershell
# Show help
.\build.ps1

# Install AutoHotkey only
.\build.ps1 -InstallAHK

# Build executable only (requires AutoHotkey)
.\build.ps1 -Build

# Install and build in one command
.\build.ps1 -InstallAHK -Build
```

## Usage

1. **Start the application** (either the .exe or .ahk file)
2. **Open a video** in Chrome or Edge and enable Picture-in-Picture mode
3. **Hover over the PiP window** - it will become semi-transparent and click-through
4. **Hold Shift** while hovering to make it fully opaque and interactive
5. **Move away** from the PiP window to restore it to normal

## Hotkeys

- **Ctrl+Alt+P**: Pause/Resume the script
- **Ctrl+Alt+X**: Exit the script

## Configuration

You can modify these settings in the `pip-controller.ahk` file:

```autohotkey
transparency := 80       ; Default transparency (0-255, where 0 is invisible)
checkInterval := 50      ; How often to check mouse position (milliseconds)
```

## How It Works

1. The script continuously monitors mouse position
2. When mouse hovers over a Picture-in-Picture window:
   - If Shift is NOT pressed: Makes window semi-transparent and click-through
   - If Shift IS pressed: Makes window fully opaque and interactive
3. When mouse moves away: Restores window to normal state

## Browser Support

- ‚úÖ Google Chrome
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge
- ‚ùì Firefox (not tested, may work with modifications)

## Troubleshooting

### PiP Window Not Detected
- Make sure the window title contains "Picture-in-picture" or "Picture in picture"
- Try restarting the script after opening PiP mode

### Script Not Working
- Check if AutoHotkey is installed properly
- Run as administrator if needed
- Ensure no other AutoHotkey scripts are interfering

### Build Fails
- Make sure you have internet connection for AutoHotkey download
- Run PowerShell as administrator
- Check Windows Defender/antivirus isn't blocking the compilation
